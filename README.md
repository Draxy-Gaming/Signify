# Signify - Blockchain Contract Signing

Welcome to Signify, your tool for secure blockchain contract signing using RSA encryption.

## Overview

Signify is a web application that allows users to sign and verify blockchain contracts using RSA encryption. It provides a simple interface for signing messages and verifying signatures with the power of JavaScript and the jsrsasign library.

## Features

- Sign messages using your private key
- Verify signatures using public key certificates
- Supports various hash algorithms (SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, MD5, RIPEMD-160)
- Easy-to-use web interface

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Draxy-Gaming/Signify/
   cd Signify
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Follow the instructions on the web page to sign and verify messages.

## Prerequisites

- Web browser with JavaScript enabled

## Usage

1. Modify the text message in the left form.
2. Choose the hash algorithm for signing (SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, MD5, RIPEMD-160).
3. Click the "Sign to this message" button.
4. Copy the signed message and paste it into the right form.
5. Click the "Verify this signature" button to check the validity.
